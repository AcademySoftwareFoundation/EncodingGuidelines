# Contributing to the ORI Encoding Guidelines

## Get Connected.

Please reach out to us, particularly if you are having a problem, since its likely somebody else is sharing that problem, and if we have not documented it, it may be something that needs to be updated.

Reach out using one of the following approaches:
   * ASWF Slack - [#open-review-initiative](#open-review-initiative)
   * [Github ORI Encoding Guidelines - discussions ](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/EncodingGuidelines/discussions)
   * If there are particular issues - [Github Issues](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/EncodingGuidelines/issues)


## Documentation Style

We are attempting to do all the documentation using markdown, in particular using [Just-the-docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs), we would encourage new documentation to be done using that format.

## Coding Style

The test suite has been developed using python-3, and has been designed to work on windows, osx and linux.
