Some of the tests use OpenImageIO
There's a build script in the tools directory.
Download OIIO tarball from: https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/releases in the root of tool directory
and run the shell script: ""./build_oiio.sg oiio-2.3.11.0.tar.gz"
replacing tarball version with the one you downloaded.
You'll find the built files in tools/oiio-2.3.11.0/build/dist

Running the encoding tests you may pass environment variables to help use the
correct tools and libraries

PATH=./tools/oiio-2.3.11.0/build/dist/bin:$PATH PYTHONPATH=./tools/oiio-2.3.11.0/build/dist/lib/python3.8/site-packages python enctest.py
